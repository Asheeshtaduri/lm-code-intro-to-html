# Introduction to HTML

## ðŸ—º Instructions

The Tech Returners Doctors Surgery has a website in desperate need of some semantic HTML tags. Currently, it has some correct tags, but in other places there are unhelpful `<div>`s and even empty `<></>` tags!

Your task is to replace the divs and empty tags with more appropriate ones.

You can find a list of different tags and explanations on when and where to use them, here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

If you get really stuck, you can find some hints [here](./hints.md).

Happy coding! ðŸ™Œ
