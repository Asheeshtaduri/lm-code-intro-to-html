# Introduction to HTML

## Getting Started

ðŸ‘‰ _Fork_ and then _clone_ this repo to your local computer

## Instructions

The Tech Returners Doctors Surgery has a website in desperate need of some semantic HTML tags. Currently, it has some correct tags, but in other places there are unhelpful `<div>`s and even empty `<></>` tags! ðŸ˜¯

Your task is to replace the divs and empty tags with more appropriate, semantic ones.

For example, instead of:

```HTML

<div>Tech Returners Surgery: Home</div>
```

Perhaps using an `<h1>` here would be more appropriate?

```HTML

<h1>Tech Returners Surgery: Home</h1>
```

ðŸ‘‰ The file for you to edit can be found [here](./index.html).

## Tips and Tricks

To open an HTML file using the command line, type the following:

```
         $ open filename.html
```

Or alternatively, right click the HTML file with your mouse and select "open".

ðŸ’¡ You can find a list of different tags and explanations on when and where to use them on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

ðŸ’¡ If you get really really stuck, you can find some hints [here](./hints.md).

Happy coding! ðŸ™Œ
