Here are a list of HTML tags that you might find in a doctors surgery website ðŸ˜‰

<!DOCTYPE html>

All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration. Technically, this isn't an HTML tag - rather it is is "information" to tell the browser what type of document to expect. You'll notice this declaration is self closing.

<html lang="en"></html>

The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document. This tag is the container for all other HTML elements except for the <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

You'll notice this has a lang attribute which specifies the language of the elements content such as "en" or English or "fr" for French etc.

<head></head>

The <head> tags contain metadata and are placed above the <body> tag.

The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

<body></body>

<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<ul></ul>
<li></li>
<a></a>
<button></button>
<section><section>

<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
...
<h6></h6>

The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

Note: Only use one <h1> per page - this should represent the main heading/subject for the whole page. Also, do not skip heading levels - start with <h1>, then use <h2>, and so on.
